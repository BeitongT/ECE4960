Task2
CHANGES:
1.I change the inputs of my previous assignment. 
In my previous assignment, I use a outer for loop to give the time to the solver.
While in lab4, I set exit time and delta time to the input of the function, so I can change the simulation time and interval easily.

2. And in the RK4 and RK34, I make a intermediate variable for all time (ti, ti + h/2, ti + h) and x (xi, xi + k1h/2, xi + k2h/2, xi + k3h) when we calculate K1 to K4. I changed this to make the code more clear and easier to debug. Because later on, the ODE will be more and more complicated.

3. I make the related variable to be vector. Because the rank of the dependent variable is no longer 1. So I need to use vector to represent the variable. I use Eigen library to achieve the vector feature.

INHERITANCE:
1. For Forward Euler method, I used the way to predict the next dependent value. 

2. For the RK4, I used the parameters for calculating K1 to K4 from my assignments.

3. For RK34, I used the time adaptation equation I used in my assignment.
